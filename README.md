A>>>>

To compile and run a WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application in Visual Studio, follow these steps:

1. Open Your Project
Launch Visual Studio.
Open your WPF project by selecting File > Open > Project/Solution and navigating to your .sln file.

2. Build the Solution

Build your project to ensure there are no errors. To do this, go to the Build menu and select Build Solution (or press Ctrl + Shift + B).
Visual Studio will compile your code and display any errors or warnings in the Error List window. Address any issues before proceeding.

3. Run the Application

To run your WPF application, you have several options:
Start Debugging: Press F5 or go to Debug > Start Debugging. This will build and run your application in debug mode, allowing you to step through your code if necessary.
Start Without Debugging: Press Ctrl + F5 or go to Debug > Start Without Debugging. This will build and run your application without attaching the debugger.

4. Check Output

Once your application starts, check the output to ensure it behaves as expected. You can interact with your application, test features, and confirm that everything is working correctly.

5. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, use the Output window (found under View > Output) to get more information on build and run errors.
You can also use breakpoints and the debugger to investigate runtime issues.

6. Package and Deploy (Optional)

If you want to package your WPF application for distribution, you can create an installer or a deployable package. Visual Studio provides tools like ClickOnce or other setup projects for this purpose.

What is This App?
This is a Recipe Management Application designed to help you organize and manage your recipes efficiently. It provides various features to enter, view, filter, and scale recipes. The application also allows you to delete recipes if needed. Here's a breakdown of what you can do with it:

Key Features
Enter Recipe Details: You can add new recipes by providing details such as the recipe name, ingredients, their quantities, units of measurement, calories, and food groups. You’ll be guided through each step to ensure you enter all the necessary information.

Display Recipe List: You can view a list of all recipes you’ve added. This list is sorted alphabetically by the recipe name for easy navigation.

Filter Recipes: This feature allows you to filter recipes based on specific criteria such as ingredient name, food group, and maximum calorie count. This makes it easier to find recipes that meet your dietary preferences or restrictions.

Clear Filters: If you’ve applied filters and want to return to viewing all recipes, you can easily clear the filters and see the full list again.

Scale Recipe: You can adjust the quantity of ingredients in a recipe by scaling it up or down. For example, if you need to double or halve the recipe, this feature will recalculate the ingredient quantities and calories accordingly.

Reset Scaling: If you’ve scaled a recipe and want to revert to the original quantities and calories, this feature allows you to reset the recipe to its initial values.

Delete Recipe: If you want to remove a recipe from the list, you can delete it. The app will confirm your action before actually removing the recipe.

Exit Application: You can close the application when you’re done.

Why Was It Created?

Organize Recipes: Keep all your recipes in one place with detailed information about each one.
Easily Access Information: Quickly view and filter recipes to find what you need.
Adjust Recipes: Scale recipes to fit different serving sizes without manually recalculating quantities and calories.
Manage Your Collection: Add, view, modify, or delete recipes as needed.
In essence, this app is designed to make recipe management simpler, more organized, and more flexible, saving you time and effort in the kitchen.
